# üïπÔ∏è 2048 - WIP (Work in Progress)

This is an implementation of the popular 2048 game built with Next.js. Currently, the project is in its early stages, and things are still under development.

## üöß Project Status
Current Status: Just started - Nothing is fully functional yet.

This project is currently under development, so expect incomplete features and missing functionality. Stay tuned for updates as I work towards building a playable version of the 2048 game.

## üìã To-Do List
Some of the key goals and tasks for this project are:

- Basic game board setup.
- Implement game logic (tile movement, merging, win condition).
- Basic UI for the game grid.
- Handle game state (score, undo, restart).
- Add animations and improve the visual experience.
- Make the game responsive for different screen sizes.
- Implement an auto-solver to automatically play the game and aim for the highest possible score.

## üí° Future Plans
The plan is to implement the core 2048 gameplay and enhance it with modern UI/UX. Features like:
